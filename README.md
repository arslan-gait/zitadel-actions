# Marketplace for ZITADLE Actions

An Identity and Management system is a very interactive place. 
ZITADEL has built in functionality to react to its events.
This functionality is called Actions and can be configured on an organization level.
Write your own javascript extensions to make ZITADEL behave in the way you need it.

This repository includes different javascript snippets that can be used in your ZITADEL instance.

## Contribute

If you have written an action for your ZITADEL instance that can also be helpful to others we love to get it inlcuded in this repository.
